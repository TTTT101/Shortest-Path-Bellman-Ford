# Shortest-Path-Bellman-Ford
Performing the shortest path using Bellman Ford algorithim to compute the distance between nodes. In this case, we minimize cost (shortest cost path) which is the sum of a shipping cost matrix and the distance matrix.

_Requirements:_

(1) Find the shortest path from each node to the node 24. Consider the l1 norm to compute the distances between nodes (l1(x − y) = ∑4i=1 |xi − yi|where x and y have 4 dimensions)

(2) Find the shortest path from node  0 to each node. Consider the l∞ norm to compute the distances between nodes (l∞(x − y) = maxi=1,...,4[|xi − yi|] where x and y have 4 dimensions).

_*Details on the norms used to compute distances in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm (mathematics)_

End result is the optimal shortest path between any two nodes - minimizing total shipping cost.
