# Shortest-Path-Bellman-Ford
Contains code implementation to find the shortest path between 25 nodes across 4 dimensions array. It represent a shipping transportation optimization problem to minimize the shipping cost. End result is most optimized shortest path between any two nodes - minimizing total shipping cost.
